# TFT-Speedometer
This speedometer is a custom-built device created using the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller, a TFT display shield, and an IR sensor. It is designed to calculate the RPM (revolutions per minute) of the motor's rotating shaft. Serving as an integral component of the vehicle dashboard, this speedometer offers crucial information about the motor's performance.
